move the "logged in as" form to the bottom of each page (it will appear if you are logged in as someone)
mess with .sql to foreign key the user to customizations
use insert into to link the user to a customization in customizations on customizations.php
fix the alignment with the customizations on customizations.php

pretty much done
push, then I will delete my repo then re-clone
